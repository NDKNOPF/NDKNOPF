- 👋 Hi, I’m @NDKNOPF
- 👀 I’m interested in learning with the free version about how to use GitHub as a repository for our various business processes, especially bits of code querying our SQL servers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, PBI, and other power platform apps. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning tips and tricks on integrating large groups with technical experience into Github with all its functionality.
- 📫 How to reach me nathan.d.knopf@gmail.com
